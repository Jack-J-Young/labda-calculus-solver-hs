# labda-calculus-solver-hs
A lambda calculus solver in Hasell made in college to automate an assignment

if you wish to run this, modify the string on line 110, an example of the format: (^x.x(ab))e, which would reduce down to e(ab)

the only sugar is currying so for example you can input (^xy.xy), this is decurried and then solved
